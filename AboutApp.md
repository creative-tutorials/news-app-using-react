    </b>
</h3>

<p>
    I used React useState Hook to manage the state of the application.
    to explain the useState Hook, I will explain the useState Hook in the next section.
    The useState Hook is a function that returns an array of two values.
    The first value is the current state of the application.
    The second value is a function that allows you to update the state of the application
